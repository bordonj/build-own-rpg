Confusion: --> WE FIGURED IT OUT! and allHaikuStore() needs to be called to show updated results after adding Haikus
- we're storing the result of functions in variables and this becomes the state
- when do we know when to store results of function in variables versus not?
- it looks like we don't always need to store them... 
- see line 124 and line 125 in our rpg.test.js

# Game Plan
- build RPG
  - NPCs
  - PCs
  - Theme? 
  - Equipment
  - Attacks/combat
    - rock paper scissors
    - haiku about rock paper scissors
    - premade haikus chosen to represent each choice (rock, paper, scissors)
    - NPC choice is made via algorithm based on a combination of their stats and yours.

  - HP/MP - character stats
  - attributes 
    - e.g., stealth, strength
  - Levels
  - Abilities
  - Locations? how to make this!?
